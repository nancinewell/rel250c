        <h2>On this page, I have recorded some scriptures that were pertinent to my efforts to increase and improve my discipleship through prayer. The scriptures themselves may not be directly about prayer, but they helped me learn about it.</h2>

                <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng#p8" target="_blank" title="2 Nephi 32:8-9 churchofjesuschrist.org">2 Nephi 32:8-9</a></p>
                <p class="scripture">8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. <span>For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</span>
                <br>9 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that <span>ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</span></p>
                <p>This was the first scripture that prompted me down the path toward choosing this project. First, because it so starkly reminded me that any thoughts, desires, excuses, etc. that I have preventing me from praying are not from God, but from Satan. Second, because I was impressed that even in my stagnant state, I perform many things unto the Lord and I need to bring them to him beforehand.</p>

                <p class="scripture">And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall <span> they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon</span>, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</p>
                <p>This scripture stuck out to me because as I was planning and pondering on my Discipleship Project, I felt strongly that this was pertinent to me. That I was finally choosing to act for myself and stop being acted upon by choosing this particular project. </p>

                <p class="scripture">14 So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God,<span> I retired to the woods to make the attempt</span>. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties <span>I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.</span></p>
                <p>When I was reading this for Come Follow Me with my children, I was reminded of a talk that I heard several years ago called <a href="talks.html#ptrh" title="Talks: Prayers That Reach Heaven">Prayers That Reach Heaven</a> by Diana Hoelscher. I have prayed out loud before, and I know from experience that it does make for better, more personal prayers. Thus, I have made this part of my plan. </p>

                <p class="scripture">22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, <span>cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">23 <span>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?</span> What greater witness can you have than from God?</p>
                <p>I was doing Come Follow Me with my little ones when I came upon this one again. I was strongly reminded of a time when I received revelation on a completely separate matter than my current question. But it wasn't the answer that came into my mind. It was the feelings. I have been so complacent and haven't been trying for so long, that was I have been feeling like I can't receive revelation. I felt like God was kindly and gently reminding me that I have, and can, feel him, and thus can receive revelation when I am ready and when it is right.</p>

                <p class="scripture"><span>Pray always, that you may come off conqueror;</span> yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work.</p>
                <p>I came across this scripture twice this week. Once as I was listening to a talk, and again as I was studying Come Follow Me. It has a powerful feeling to me. We often talk about enduring, which seems like simply making it through, but this speaks of conquering. I feel it is much more applicable to our goals in this life. We aren't trying to simply make it to the end, but finish with flying colors, conquering all that Satan tries to put in our path to hinder us.</p>

                <p class="scripture">38 <span>Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your blessing</span>—yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof.
                <br>39 Behold, <span>canst thou read this without rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for gladness?</span>
                <br>40 Or canst thou run about longer as a blind guide?
                <br>41 Or canst thou be humble and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me? Yea, <span>come unto me thy Savior.</span> Amen.</p>
                <p>This scripture came up today as I was watching the Friend to Friend broadcast with my children. I intended to only include verse 38, but when I went to look it up and kept reading, the rest of the section stood out to me as well. I love the joyfullness of it, and the invitation from the Lord. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng#p8" target="_blank" title="Matthew 6:8-13 churchofjesuschrist.org">Matthew 6:8-13</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">7 But <span>when ye pray, use not vain repetitions</span>, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
                <br>8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
                <br>9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
                <br>10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
                <br>11 Give us this day our daily bread.
                <br>12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
                <br>13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
                <p>This stood out to me with a few random thoughts in my brain. First that popped into my head is how many recite this prayer, even though right before it the scriptures say not to use repetitive prayers.</p>
                <p>So if we are not to repeat prayers, what do we learn from this prayer? 
                    <ol>
                        <li>A reverent opening</li>
                        <li>Focus on God's will, not our own</li>
                        <li>Ask for immediate needs</li>
                        <li>Repent (and don't forget we are to forgive others if we are to be forgiven)</li>
                    </ol>
                    I'm not sure what to get out of the last bit. Lead us not into temptation? Why would God ever do that? Could it be the translation that has me so hung up?
                </p>

                <p class="scripture">7 <span>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers</span>, to answer them in the day of their trouble.
                <br>8 <span>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel;</span> but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</p>
                <p>It seems pretty clear that after living complacently for so long, it is unreasonable to expect God to suddenly start answering my prayers now that I have suddenly started to pray. It will take time. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1?lang=eng#p26" target="_blank" title="Omni 1:26 churchofjesuschrist.org">Omni 1:26</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and <span>offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end;</span> and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</p>
                <p>As I read this one, I thought also of the scripture listed above, D&C 101:7-8. Omni extends this invitation and tells you what to do, but doesn't give any assurances about receiving revelation, feeling the spirit, etc. Only that we will be saved. It occurred to me that there may be times when we must press on in fasting and prayer, and endure even silence from heaven... particularly if, like mentioned above, we have been slow to hearken to the Lord before now.</p>

                <p class="scripture">Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, <span>I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself.</span> And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.</p>
                <p>This is Alma the Younger, after his conversion. After seeing an angel, turning his life around, repenting of all the sins he committed, he still needed to fast and pray for many days to know truth and receive personal revelation from the Lord. I was just thinking about how my earlier reading had me believing that the Lord was, for lack of better words, giving me the silent treatment, but even someone who had devoted his life to the Lord after his conversion needed to take many days of fasting and prayer to know the truth of things. Perhaps I'm just giving up too quickly. I'm too accustomed to immediate gratification.</p>

                <p class="scripture">Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, <span>wrestling with God in mighty prayer</span>, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.</p>
                <p>I was just thinking about how Alma's prayer was so wholely devoted to a righteous desire to spread the gospel and teach others of the goodness of God. Yet, even in this, he was "wrestling" with God in prayer, and the answer was eventually no. He was rejected in Ammonihah and had to leave. </p>

                <p class="scripture">Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and <span> prayeth continually without ceasing </span>—unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.</p>
                <p>I have a hard time remembering to pray at all... How do people pray unceasingly? </p>

                <p class="scripture">14 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.
                    <br>15 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.
                    <br>16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.
                    <br>17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may <span>begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;
                    <br>18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.
                    <br>19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.
                    <br>20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.
                    <br>21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and evening.
                    <br>22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.
                    <br>23 Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness.
                    <br>24 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them.
                    <br>25 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.
                    <br>26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.
                    <br>27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</span>
                    <br>28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, <span>if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</span>
                    <br>29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</p>
                    <p>I've loved verse 26 for a long time. Whenever I think about pouring out your soul in your wilderness, it was always an abstract, mental wilderness I thought about. At times, I feel like there is a place within myself where I am just lost and vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>I also think about how Joseph and Enos prayed in the woods, and where could I go that would be equally isolated? As a city dweller, I have no wilderness nearby and generally have to settle for locking my bedroom door so my kids won't barge in.</p>
                    <p>This time as I read this, all of these verses belonged together to me. Not only instruction on prayer, but important instruction after that about charity, and now prayer without charity is worthless. So I must ask myself, how can I be more charitable?</p>

                <p>How often is "oft"? Is fasting once a month "oft"? Fasting is so difficult. I feel like a child, but fasting makes me grumpy, not more spiritual. What do I need to do to make fasting a spiritual experience?</p>

                </p>
                <p>I remember learning in a religion class that when the Lord repeats himself, it's because it's very important. Here again we see the idea of praying always/praying unceasingly. I'm sure if I search, I'll find it in more places. As I read this today, I was reminded of something my mother-in-law told me several years ago. She said that she begins her day with a prayer, and doesn't close it. She leaves it open all day, and just adds to it throughout the day. I think I would like to try this, but to be perfectly honest, I fear that I'll leave it open indefinitely as I forget about it during the day. Even with my weeks of effort, I still struggle simply to remember to pray. It's just very discouraging. Trying to make this change in myself seems insurmountable at times.</p>

                <br>8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
                <br>9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?

                <br>11 <span>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span></p>
                <p>I actually said something similar to this earlier this week before reading it. I was talking to my little ones. I asked my 5 year old if she knows that Heavenly Father loves her. She said, "No." So I asked her if she knows if I love her, and she brightened right up and said, "Yes!" Then I explained that I love her sooo much, and if I can love her this much and I am not perfect, can she even imagine how much more her perfect Father in Heaven loves her? It earned me extra cuddles, and got me reflecting on how much I love these little ones, and helped me to remember that I am loved even more than that by my Father in Heaven.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/prayer?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="Prayer churchofjesuschrist.org">Prayer</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are His children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part (Matt. 7:7–11). Many of the so-called difficulties about prayer arise from forgetting this relationship. Prayer is the act by which the will of the Father and the will of the child are brought into correspondence with each other. The object of prayer is not to change the will of God but to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that God is already willing to grant but that are made conditional on our asking for them. Blessings require some work or effort on our part before we can obtain them. Prayer is a form of work and is an appointed means for obtaining the highest of all blessings.</p>
                <p>On a whim, I looked up prayer in the Bible Dictionary. To be honest, I didn't expect to find much more than an explanation of how prayer is communication with God. There was actually a very lengthy entry about prayer, and this particular paragraph stood out to me the most. I guess I had forgotten that many blessings are conditional on us asking. I know that I have felt it silly to ask for particular things because if God wills it, it'll be done. This was a wonderful reminder of the purpose of prayer.</p>

                <p class="scripture">3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?
                <br>4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.
                <br> Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.
                <br>6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my prayer.</p>
                <p>While this passage did make me thoughtful of prayer, and how God needs no building, synagogue, or anything else to hear his people, but I was actually more touched that Alma quoted a prophet, Zenos, that otherwise would have been lost in time. The writings of Zenos are not found in any other place that I know of than the Book of Mormon. Because Alma and a few others quoted him, meaning that they read and remembered them to share them with others, we, thousands of years later, still receive the benefit of his teachings. </p>
                <p>This really brought to mind the old saying that if you want to talk to God, pray. If you want God to talk to you, read the scriptures. Because these men learned their scriptures, we can, too.</p>
