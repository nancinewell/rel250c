        <p>On this page, I have recorded some scriptures that were pertinent to my efforts to increase and improve my discipleship through prayer. The scriptures themselves may not be directly about prayer, but they helped me learn about it.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="2 Nephi 32:8-9 churchofjesuschrist.org">2 Nephi 32:8-9</a></p>
                <p class="scripture">8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. <span>For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</span>
                <br>9 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint; that <span>ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.</span></p>
                <p>This was the first scripture that prompted me down the path toward choosing this project. First, because it so starkly reminded me that any thoughts, desires, excuses, etc. that I have preventing me from praying are not from God, but from Satan. Second, because I was impressed that even in my stagnant state, I perform many things unto the Lord and I need to bring them to him beforehand.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="2 Nephi 2:26 churchofjesuschrist.org">2 Nephi 2:26</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall <span> they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon</span>, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</p>
                <p>This scripture stuck out to me because as I was planning and pondering on my Discipleship Project, I felt strongly that this was pertinent to me. That I was finally choosing to act for myself and stop being acted upon by choosing this particular project. </p>

                <p class="scripture">14 So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God,<span> I retired to the woods to make the attempt</span>. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties <span>I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.</span></p>
                <p>When I was reading this for Come Follow Me with my children, I was reminded of a talk that I heard several years ago called <a href="talks.html#ptrh" title="Talks: Prayers That Reach Heaven">Prayers That Reach Heaven</a> by Diana Hoelscher. I have prayed out loud before, and I know from experience that it does make for better, more personal prayers. Thus, I have made this part of my plan. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="D&C 6:22-23 churchofjesuschrist.org">D&C 6:22-23</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, <span>cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">23 <span>Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter?</span> What greater witness can you have than from God?</p>
                <p>I was doing Come Follow Me with my little ones when I came upon this one again. I was strongly reminded of a time when I received revelation on a completely separate matter than my current question. But it wasn't the answer that came into my mind. It was the feelings. I have been so complacent and haven't been trying for so long, that was I have been feeling like I can't receive revelation. I felt like God was kindly and gently reminding me that I have, and can, feel him, and thus can receive revelation when I am ready and when it is right.</p>
