        <h2>On this page, I have recorded some talks from which I gained insights pertinent to my efforts to increase and improve my discipleship through prayer. The talks themselves may not be directly about prayer, but they helped me learn about it.</h2>

                <h3 id="ptrh"><a href="https://deseretbook.com/p/prayers-reach-heaven-diana-hoelscher-38206?variant_id=65490-audiobook-mp3-" title="Prayers That Reach Heaven  deseretbook.com">Prayers That Reach Heaven</a></h3>
                <p>I haven't heard this talk in a long time. When, during my Come Follow Me reading with my children, we came across <a href="scriptures.html#jsh114" title="Scriptures: Joseph Smith History - 1:14">Joseph Smith History - 1:14</a>, I was strongly reminded of Diana's experience teaching her sister to pray out loud. That, of course, led me to listen to the talk again. </p>
                <p>A few things stood out to me. Before she shares the experience with her sister, she talks about another experience she had on her mission. While bearing his testimony, another missionary said, "As I was preparing to say my personal prayers..." While I know that I have heard this talk before, I do not recall ever preparing to say my prayers. Goodness, my goal is just to say prayers at all. But this stood out powerfully. I'll need to do something about it.</p>
                <p>She then talked about a pattern for prayer established in the scriptures. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go somewhere to be alone</li>
                        <li>Kneel down</li>
                        <li>Prepare yourself to pray</li>
                        <li>Speak out loud</li>
                        <li>Ask for confirmation</li>
                        <li>Listen</li>
                    </ol>
                She talked quite a bit about asking for confirmation. It's important that you don't ask "should I do this or shouldn't I?" What is he supposed to say? Yes, you should and shouldn't? No, you need to study it out in your mind, ponder on it, make your decision, then ask for the Spirit to confirm the truth of it. He will.</p>
                <p>And if you want to get more than a yes/no answer, if you want God to be able to really talk to you, memorize verses of scripture and hymns. When you do, God will speak to you in whole phrases. He will bring to your mind the things you have learned to help answer your questions.</p>

                <h3><a href="" target="_blank" title="What Lack I Yet?  churchofjesuschrist.org">What Lack I Yet?</a></h3>
                <p>I read this one in preparation for my Dischipleship Project as part of the instructions, but there were several things that I highlighted and want to put them here to help me remember.</p>
                <p class="scripture">" <span> Sometimes we need to ask what we are doing right </span> so that the Lord can lift and encourage us. When we <span>read our patriarchal blessings</span>, we are reminded that our Heavenly Father knows our divine potential. He rejoices every time we take a step forward. To him, <span>our direction is ever more important than our speed</span>... <span>It is our duty to be better today than we were yesterday, and better tomorrow than we are today</span> ... <span> The Holy Ghost doesn't tell us to improve everything at once</span>. If he did, we would become discouraged and give up. <span>The Spirit works with us at our own speed</span>, one step at a time, or as the Lord has taught, 'line upon line, precept upon precept, ... and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, ... for unto him that receiveth I will give more.'"</p>
                <p>This was a wonderful reminder to me that it's not all about what I'm not doing, what I'm not good at, what I'm failing in, or what I'm lacking. It's also about what I'm doing right, what I'm doing better, what I'm doing more, and what I am succeeding in. This was very moving to me as I face my own deficiencies. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="Two Lines of Communication  churchofjesuschrist.org">Two Lines of Communication</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">In the personal line we pray directly to our Heavenly Father, and He answers us by the channels He has established, without any mortal intermediary. We pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, and He answers us through His Holy Spirit and in other ways. The mission of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son (see John 15:26; 2 Nephi 31:18; 3 Nephi 28:11), <span>to guide us into truth </span>(see John 14:26; 16:13), and to <span>show us all things we should do</span> (see 2 Nephi 32:5). <span>This personal line of communication with our Heavenly Father through His Holy Spirit is the source of our testimony of truth, of our knowledge, and of our personal guidance from a loving Heavenly Father. </span>It is an essential feature of His marvelous gospel plan, which <span>allows each one of His children to receive a personal witness of its truth...</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">The personal line is of paramount importance in personal decisions and in the governance of the family. Unfortunately, some members of our church underestimate the need for this direct, personal line. Responding to the undoubted importance of prophetic leadership—the priesthood line, which operates principally to govern heavenly communications on Church matters— <span>some seek to have their priesthood leaders make personal decisions for them, decisions they should make for themselves by inspiration through their personal line</span>. Personal decisions and family governance are principally a matter for the personal line.</p>
                <p>As previously mentioned, I have had a question of deep personal importance to me come up recently. As my husband and I have discussed it, there are frequent attempts to locate an answer from the teachings of the prophets, but there is nothing to be found. An important part of this project is my improving my prayers so that I can improve my ability to receive personal revelation so that I can know for certain the answer to this question.</p>

                <p class="scripture">We do not all have to hear Him the same way. I believe what is meaningful is that <span>we do hear</span> and that <span>we recognize His voice so that we can learn to heed Him more frequently.</span></p>
                <p>I opened churchofjesuschrist.org to check out a new feature I was alerted to regarding my son's seminary. The first thing I saw was a blog post by Joy D. Jones. It caught my eye because of my current Discipleship Project, so I took a few minutes to read. Sister Jones talks about many ways in which she hears him and it got me thinking about how I hear him. With a Discipleship project about more meaningful prayer, how else could I achieve that than improving my ability to hear him? </p>

                <p class="scripture"><span>We've got to really pray, not just say prayers...</span> Section 10 of the Doctrine and Covenants says, "Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work." See, if you're studying the scriptures and you're praying about them, and you have the spirit, remember what Brigham Young said, you will have the spirit to know that what our leaders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is true.</p>
                <p>Not included in the excerpt is a story Brother Christianson told of two young teenage boys who got into some harmless mischief. The police chief, a good friend of their father's, wanted to teach them a lesson, so he took them in to the local jail and they spent Saturday night there. On Sunday, they decided to hold their own Sunday School. One opened with a prayer, where he said the well known "Thank you for the chance we have to meet together. Thank you for this building we can meet in. Please bless those who are not with us this week that they can join us next week."  In their current location, it illustrates how laughable it is to say such rote prayers, but also the imporance of sincere prayers.</p>
                <p>I haven't had the problem of repetitious prayers for some time, but I was reminded how much Heavenly Father would rather hear from my heart than just hear me speak (if that makes sense - it does to me).</p>

                <p class="scripture">If your prayers don’t always seem answered, take heart. One greater than you cried, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" If for a while the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart. So it has been with the best people who ever lived.</p>
                <p>The transcript for this talk was assigned, but I prefer listening to this talk and so located an audio version that I could listen to while reading. The audio/live version has quite a bit more than the transcript assigned. </p>
                <p>Elder Holland shared an experience of a man who desperately wanted to know if his calling was truly of God. His painstaking experience with prayer and that assurance did not come helped me a great deal as I have been pleading for an answer to my own question of the Lord. As I listened to this man's experience, I suddenly felt encouraged that not only am I not alone, but that I do not get to receive answers simply because they are convenient. I cannot let this make me feel forgotten or unloved.</p>

                <p class="scripture">There's an old Jewish proverb that says a man was sitting and he looked in the distance and he saw a blur, and then as it got closer, he said, "Oh, it's a man." And then as it got a little closer, he saw that it was a neighbor of his and finally as the man got very very close, he identified him as his friend... And the idea behind that was that the distance, <span>the farther away you are from a person, then the more sterile or unrecognizable they become. So it is with God.</span> When we talk about Jesus Christ, for example, it's easy to talk about the Savior in the sense of, "Is Jesus the Christ?" and I think we could all stand and say, "Yes, Jesus is the Christ." Well, <span>what about your relationship with the Savior? How do you feel about you and that relationship on an individual basis?</span></p>
                <p>I've been feeling like my relationship to Christ is more like the blur than the friend. Yesterday I was substitute teaching the 11 year old Sunday School class, and as is customary I bore my testimony at the end of class. I found myself floundering a little with what to say. I'm just struggling despite my efforts. It's very discouraging.</p>

                <p class="scripture">This process requires far more than acquiring knowledge. <span>It is not even enough for us to be convinced of the gospel; we must act and think so that we are converted by it.</span> In contrast to the institutions of the world, which teach us to know something, <span>the gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become something</span>...</p>
                <p class="scripture">Moroni declares, <span>“He that is filthy shall be filthy still;</span> and he that is righteous shall be righteous still” (Morm. 9:14; emphasis added; see also Rev. 22:11–12; 2 Ne. 9:16; D&C 88:35). <span>The same would be true of “selfish” or “disobedient” or any other personal attribute inconsistent with the requirements of God</span>...</p>
                <p class="scripture">From such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts—what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts—what we have become. <span>It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account.</span> The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become...</p>
                <p class="scripture"><span>Now is the time for each of us to work toward our personal conversion, toward becoming what our Heavenly Father desires us to become.</span>As we do so, we should remember that our family relationships—even more than our Church callings—are the setting in which the most important part of that development can occur. <span>The conversion we must achieve requires us to be a good husband and father or a good wife and mother.</span> Being a successful Church leader is not enough. Exaltation is an eternal family experience, and it is our mortal family experiences that are best suited to prepare us for it...</p>
                <p class="scripture">The reason charity never fails and the reason charity is greater than even the most significant acts of goodness he cited is that charity, “the pure love of Christ” (Moro. 7:47), <span>is not an act but a condition or state of being. Charity is attained through a succession of acts that result in a conversion. Charity is something one becomes.</span> Thus, as Moroni declared, “except men shall have charity they cannot inherit” the place prepared for them in the mansions of the Father (Ether 12:34)...</p>
                <p>Though this talk was part of our "Prepare" studies, I found it very pertinent to me and my efforts. I am trying to make my prayers more meaningful, but I often feel like I'm going through the motions without much success. I cannot just set an alarm to pray. I need to choose to pray because I want to pray, not because my alarm reminds me it's time to pray.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="The Challenge to Become  churchofjesuschrist.org">The Challenge to Become</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">[Referring to the parable of the servants in the vineyard.] Like other parables, this one can teach several different and valuable principles. For present purposes its lesson is that the Master’s reward in the Final Judgment will not be based on how long we have labored in the vineyard. We do not obtain our heavenly reward by punching a time clock. <span>What is essential is that our labors in the workplace of the Lord have caused us to become something. For some of us, this requires a longer time than for others.</span> What is important in the end is what we have become by our labors. Many who come in the eleventh hour have been refined and prepared by the Lord in ways other than formal employment in the vineyard. These workers are like the prepared dry mix to which it is only necessary to “add water”—the perfecting ordinance of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. With that addition—even in the eleventh hour—these workers are in the same state of development and qualified to receive the same reward as those who have labored long in the vineyard.</p>
                <p>I sectioned out this piece into it's own space because the information it conveys to me is different from that which the rest of the talk did. This is a very different perspective on this parable than I have thought about. I remember learning about this parable from the perspective of the workers. Those who were chose early in the day worked with the assurance that they would be able to feed their families that night. All day they worked without a care, knowing their family would be taken of because of that labor. Those who were chosen later and later in the day had experienced more and more stress and apprehension connected to this same concern. How would they be able to feed their families today? As the day wore on, they surely became more and more hopeless that they would be able to send support their loved ones. Who, then, was more blessed? Those who worked all day knowing their families would be fed, or those who had the good fortune of being hired at the last hour who fretted all day at the lack of work? </p>
                <p>To consider that some of use need more time to be work to become what he would have us become is not something that I had ever thought of when reading this parable. </p>
