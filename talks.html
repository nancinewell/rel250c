        <p>On this page, I have recorded some talks from which I gained insights pertinent to my efforts to increase and improve my discipleship through prayer. The talks themselves may not be directly about prayer, but they helped me learn about it.</p>

                <h3 id="ptrh"><a href="https://deseretbook.com/p/prayers-reach-heaven-diana-hoelscher-38206?variant_id=65490-audiobook-mp3-" title="Prayers That Reach Heaven  deseretbook.com">Prayers That Reach Heaven</a></h3>
                <p>I haven't heard this talk in a long time. When, during my Come Follow Me reading with my children, we came across <a href="scriptures.html#jsh114" title="Scriptures: Joseph Smith History - 1:14">Joseph Smith History - 1:14</a>, I was strongly reminded of Diana's experience teaching her sister to pray out loud. That, of course, led me to listen to the talk again. </p>
                <p>A few things stood out to me. Before she shares the experience with her sister, she talks about another experience she had on her mission. While bearing his testimony, another missionary said, "As I was preparing to say my personal prayers..." While I know that I have heard this talk before, I do not recall ever preparing to say my prayers. Goodness, my goal is just to say prayers at all. But this stood out powerfully. I'll need to do something about it.</p>
                <p>She then talked about a pattern for prayer established in the scriptures. 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go somewhere to be alone</li>
                        <li>Kneel down</li>
                        <li>Prepare yourself to pray</li>
                        <li>Speak out loud</li>
                        <li>Ask for confirmation</li>
                        <li>Listen</li>
                    </ol>
                She talked quite a bit about asking for confirmation. It's important that you don't ask "should I do this or shouldn't I?" What is he supposed to say? Yes, you should and shouldn't? No, you need to study it out in your mind, ponder on it, make your decision, then ask for the Spirit to confirm the truth of it. He will.</p>
                <p>And if you want to get more than a yes/no answer, if you want God to be able to really talk to you, memorize verses of scripture and hymns. When you do, God will speak to you in whole phrases. He will bring to your mind the things you have learned to help answer your questions.</p>

                <h3><a href="" target="_blank" title="What Lack I Yet?  churchofjesuschrist.org">What Lack I Yet?</a></h3>
                <p>I read this one in preparation for my Dischipleship Project as part of the instructions, but there were several things that I highlighted and want to put them here to help me remember.</p>
                <p class="scripture">" <span> Sometimes we need to ask what we are doing right </span> so that the Lord can lift and encourage us. When we <span>read our patriarchal blessings</span>, we are reminded that our Heavenly Father knows our divine potential. He rejoices every time we take a step forward. To him, <span>our direction is ever more important than our speed</span>... <span>It is our duty to be better today than we were yesterday, and better tomorrow than we are today</span> ... <span> The Holy Ghost doesn't tell us to improve everything at once</span>. If he did, we would become discouraged and give up. <span>The Spirit works with us at our own speed</span>, one step at a time, or as the Lord has taught, 'line upon line, precept upon precept, ... and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, ... for unto him that receiveth I will give more.'"</p>
                <p>This was a wonderful reminder to me that it's not all about what I'm not doing, what I'm not good at, what I'm failing in, or what I'm lacking. It's also about what I'm doing right, what I'm doing better, what I'm doing more, and what I am succeeding in. This was very moving to me as I face my own deficiencies. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/10/two-lines-of-communication?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="Two Lines of Communication  churchofjesuschrist.org">Two Lines of Communication</a></h3>
                <p class="scripture">In the personal line we pray directly to our Heavenly Father, and He answers us by the channels He has established, without any mortal intermediary. We pray to our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, and He answers us through His Holy Spirit and in other ways. The mission of the Holy Ghost is to testify of the Father and the Son (see John 15:26; 2 Nephi 31:18; 3 Nephi 28:11), <span>to guide us into truth </span>(see John 14:26; 16:13), and to <span>show us all things we should do</span> (see 2 Nephi 32:5). <span>This personal line of communication with our Heavenly Father through His Holy Spirit is the source of our testimony of truth, of our knowledge, and of our personal guidance from a loving Heavenly Father. </span>It is an essential feature of His marvelous gospel plan, which <span>allows each one of His children to receive a personal witness of its truth...</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">The personal line is of paramount importance in personal decisions and in the governance of the family. Unfortunately, some members of our church underestimate the need for this direct, personal line. Responding to the undoubted importance of prophetic leadership—the priesthood line, which operates principally to govern heavenly communications on Church matters— <span>some seek to have their priesthood leaders make personal decisions for them, decisions they should make for themselves by inspiration through their personal line</span>. Personal decisions and family governance are principally a matter for the personal line.</p>
                <p>As previously mentioned, I have had a question of deep personal importance to me come up recently. As my husband and I have discussed it, there are frequent attempts to locate an answer from the teachings of the prophets, but there is nothing to be found. An important part of this project is my improving my prayers so that I can improve my ability to receive personal revelation so that I can know for certain the answer to this question.</p>
