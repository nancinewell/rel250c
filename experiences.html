        <p>On this page, I have recorded some experiences that were pertinent to my efforts to increase and improve my discipleship through prayer.</p>

            <h3>1/20/21</h3>
            <p>Today I woke up and saw my newly posted scripture (2 Nephi 32:8-9). I noticed particularly "ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul." I thought of the many things I "perform unto the Lord," being a wife, mother, and teacher to start with. Additionally, I thought of a story I read my children yesterday, The Fisherman's Wife by The Brothers Grimm. We had talked at length about greediness, selfishness, and discontentment. My husband and I have been looking to buy a new house for well over a year, and nothing is ever good enough <em>and</em> within our price range. Thinking of these things, I directed this morning's prayer to gratitude and asking that God would consecrate my efforts as a mother, a wife, and a teacher today, that I might recognize guidance that will help these efforts be for my welfare.</p>
            <p>After spending more time than I expected on my knees, I got up to begin my day. I immediately thought that I could really use an alarm to help me remember to pray in the afternoon. As I set it, I thought about how quickly I dismiss alarms, mostly because their sounds are annoying (done on purpose to grab my attention). I set out to find an appropriate sound for an alarm to remind me to pray, and the hymn "Did You Think To Pray" entered my mind and would not leave. I located an instrumental version of the song and set it as my alarm, so that when the alarm goes off, it will not be an annoying "DON'T FORGET TO DO SOMETHING", but instead will be a gentle reminder through the message of the music. Below is the particular rendition I downloaded. It is beautiful.</p>
            <p>The alarm worked perfectly this afternoon. I was not harried, annoyed, or rushed to shut it off. </p>

                <h3>1/22/21</h3>
                <p>I had a late night, and was rather grumpy when I woke up. I got out of bed and tried to get ready for the day, but I couldn't find my hairbrush anywhere. I searched and searched, and asked my family. No one could find it. Coming back into my room, I saw the quoted scripture I had posted to remind me to pray, so I prayed. I told Heavenly Father about how I felt silly asking for this help, but I had to be somewhere and I just really needed to find that confounded brush. I even told him how I know he knows that I normally only do something like that to teach my children to pray, but here I was asking for this trivial help anyway. I prayed, then tried to listen. My first thought upon completing the prayer was to do the laundry. So I got up to do it thinking, "Ahhh - I'll bet the littles tossed my brush in there!" So I put on a load of laundry, which is not something I do in the morning. The brush was not there. After I emptied the hamper and started the load, I felt a little disappointed, and then a little silly as a thought came into my mind that I needed to just move on with my day. It wasn't that important. It was not what I was looking for in an answer, but I actually felt like it was my answer. Just move one, it'll turn up. And it did. A few hours later, found by the person who hid it.</p>

                <p class="scripture">Jacob 2:17 reads, “Think of your [brothers and sisters] like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.” Let’s replace the word substance with mercy—be free with your mercy that they may be rich like unto you.</p>
                <p class="scripture">We often think of substance in terms of food or money, but perhaps what <span>we all need more of in our ministering is mercy.</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">...Our covenantal assignment is to <span>minister, to lift up the hands that hang down, to put struggling people on our backs or in our arms and carry them. It isn’t complicated to know what to do, but it often goes against our selfish interests, and we have to try.</span></p>
                <p>I was reading this talk in preparation for the Relief Society lesson later this month. It prompted me to check in on my ministering sisters to see how they're doing. We mostly text since not many people are interested in hanging out, especially if we can't be outdoors because of the cold. As I texted, one of the sisters said that her family is having a rough day and was in need of prayers. I always get frustrated when people say "pray for my family" because I want to do something more substantial. I texted her back and asked what else I can do to help her. Babysit? Playdate? Pick up groceries? Girls night out? Make her dinner? She kindly texted back "Just prayers."</p>
                <p>I felt a bit chastised, and not by her. I felt like God was chastising me for choosing to offer those things because he knew that I was offering them, not out of a desire to fulfill her need, but because by "just praying" I felt like I was doing nothing. Suffice it to say, I repented.</p>
