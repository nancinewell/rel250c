            <h3>1/20/21</h3>
            <p>Today I woke up and saw my newly posted scripture (2 Nephi 32:8-9). I noticed particularly "ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul." I thought of the many things I "perform unto the Lord," being a wife, mother, and teacher to start with. Additionally, I thought of a story I read my children yesterday, The Fisherman's Wife by The Brothers Grimm. We had talked at length about greediness, selfishness, and discontentment. My husband and I have been looking to buy a new house for well over a year, and nothing is ever good enough <em>and</em> within our price range. Thinking of these things, I directed this morning's prayer to gratitude and asking that God would consecrate my efforts as a mother, a wife, and a teacher today, that I might recognize guidance that will help these efforts be for my welfare.</p>
            <p>After spending more time than I expected on my knees, I got up to begin my day. I immediately thought that I could really use an alarm to help me remember to pray in the afternoon. As I set it, I thought about how quickly I dismiss alarms, mostly because their sounds are annoying (done on purpose to grab my attention). I set out to find an appropriate sound for an alarm to remind me to pray, and the hymn "Did You Think To Pray" entered my mind and would not leave. I located an instrumental version of the song and set it as my alarm, so that when the alarm goes off, it will not be an annoying "DON'T FORGET TO DO SOMETHING", but instead will be a gentle reminder through the message of the music. Below is the particular rendition I downloaded. It is beautiful.</p>
            <p>The alarm worked perfectly this afternoon. I was not harried, annoyed, or rushed to shut it off. </p>

                <h3>1/22/21</h3>
                <p>I had a late night, and was rather grumpy when I woke up. I got out of bed and tried to get ready for the day, but I couldn't find my hairbrush anywhere. I searched and searched, and asked my family. No one could find it. Coming back into my room, I saw the quoted scripture I had posted to remind me to pray, so I prayed. I told Heavenly Father about how I felt silly asking for this help, but I had to be somewhere and I just really needed to find that confounded brush. I even told him how I know he knows that I normally only do something like that to teach my children to pray, but here I was asking for this trivial help anyway. I prayed, then tried to listen. My first thought upon completing the prayer was to do the laundry. So I got up to do it thinking, "Ahhh - I'll bet the littles tossed my brush in there!" So I put on a load of laundry, which is not something I do in the morning. The brush was not there. After I emptied the hamper and started the load, I felt a little disappointed, and then a little silly as a thought came into my mind that I needed to just move on with my day. It wasn't that important. It was not what I was looking for in an answer, but I actually felt like it was my answer. Just move one, it'll turn up. And it did. A few hours later, found by the person who hid it.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/10/31eubank?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="By Union of Feeling We Obtain Power with God  churchofjesuschrist.org">By Union of Feeling We Obtain Power with God</a></p>
                <p class="scripture">Jacob 2:17 reads, “Think of your [brothers and sisters] like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.” Let’s replace the word substance with mercy—be free with your mercy that they may be rich like unto you.</p>
                <p class="scripture">We often think of substance in terms of food or money, but perhaps what <span>we all need more of in our ministering is mercy.</span></p>
                <p class="scripture">...Our covenantal assignment is to <span>minister, to lift up the hands that hang down, to put struggling people on our backs or in our arms and carry them. It isn’t complicated to know what to do, but it often goes against our selfish interests, and we have to try.</span></p>
                <p>I was reading this talk in preparation for the Relief Society lesson later this month. It prompted me to check in on my ministering sisters to see how they're doing. We mostly text since not many people are interested in hanging out, especially if we can't be outdoors because of the cold. As I texted, one of the sisters said that her family is having a rough day and was in need of prayers. I always get frustrated when people say "pray for my family" because I want to do something more substantial. I texted her back and asked what else I can do to help her. Babysit? Playdate? Pick up groceries? Girls night out? Make her dinner? She kindly texted back "Just prayers."</p>
                <p>I felt a bit chastised, and not by her. I felt like God was chastising me for choosing to offer those things because he knew that I was offering them, not out of a desire to fulfill her need, but because by "just praying" I felt like I was doing nothing. Suffice it to say, I repented.</p>

                <h3>2/4/2021</h3>
                <p>We had the missionaries over for dinner tonight. They shared this video with us. As I watched it with my family and the sisters, I felt powerfully moved by it. It doesn't pertain to prayer directly, but I have felt this yearning for home recently. I feel that it is what prompted me to take this class and to choose this particular Discipleship Project. I yearn for more.</p>

                <h3>2/6/2021</h3>
                <p>After reading <a href="talks.html#hear-him" title="See Consistently Striving to 'Hear Him'">this talk</a>, I decided to ponder on ways that I "Hear Him." </p>
                <p>My first thought was rare moments of powerful calm that have come when I was in deep need of comfort. Like when I was afraid I had miscarried during a pregnancy, but the appointment with the doctor was not until the next day. I was full of fear and despair and in desperate need of help. The Lord both calmed me and assured me that the miscarriage had already happened and all would be okay. This is an experience that I turn to when I am feeling a bit lost, like now, because I cannot deny the feelings that I experienced that night. But this is not how I usually "Hear Him."</p>
                <p>My next thought was how I sometimes feel a warm calmness when I am searching for an answer, and receive confirmation. This is what I recognize as having prayers answered, but I have not felt it for a while.</p>
                <p>My next thought was about when I feel the spirit when listening to music or watching something moving. I always cry. It's like my heart understands something more powerfully than my head does. It makes me feel like there's something deep being perceived by my own spirit, but I can't quite grasp the full meaning of it. I was reminded of that feeling when I watched Migration: A Yearning for Home (see above). </p>

                <h3>2/13/2021</h3>
                <p>I have been praying regularly, asking for an answer to my question. I talk to my husband regularly about it, too. He feels like he has an answer, but I still don't. As I listened to him explaining his point of view, how he asked his question, and how he went about it, I felt somewhat discouraged. As I was praying again, I remembered the first time I went to the temple and received my own endowment. I remembered certain wording in the covenants that made me feel more comfortable about the current status quo. I can listen to and lean on my husband for spiritual matters, too, not just temporal matters. I will continue to do what I can to recognize when I receive an answer from the Lord, but until then I can counsel with and lean on him.</p>

                <h3>3/5/2021</h3>
                <p>Today, I did the Teach A Friend with my little children using the Lesson Plan prepared for the discussion board. While my children were acting out ways to help someone who is hurt or sad, my neighbor knocked at the door, there to pick up a book she was borrowing. We talked for a few hours. In the beginning, my 5 year old came up and told her about pretending to ride a bike and then she fell off and got hurt, but not really hurt, just pretend hurt, and then brother felt sad with her and came and helped her.</p>
                <p> Since this didn't make much sense, I explained the lesson we were doing, and the purpose to teach that Jesus mourns with us from the story of raising Lazarus from the dead. She really liked that we were doing that and that she wanted to teach her little ones, too, but didn't have much knowledge or foundation in scriptural things because her father created a negative religious environment growing up. She said her mom used to read a children's bible and she'd really like something like that. I happen to have a Childrens Scripture Stories book that includes the Old and New Testaments as well as the Book of Mormon and Church History. I explained the book a little and let her know the church that we belong to. I explained that we believe that after Jesus Christ was resurrected, he taught more people, and the Book of Mormon is an account of those people. She thought that was a really cool possibility, and it led to more discussion of beliefs. She mentioned several things that have always bothered her about religion as taught by her parents, such as the idea that unbaptized babies would go to Hell. Each of the things she had always had problems with allowed me to talk briefly about how our beliefs differ from what other Christians believe and she liked all of them. She laughed and said, "Maybe I'm a Mormon."</p>
                <p>This experience is very rare for me. I keep to myself a lot and don't find it easy to make friends, so I don't often get opportunities to talk to others about my beliefs. With my dischipleship project, I have been trying very hard to pray without the reminder from my alarm, and have tried to remember to ask for help in doing what he would have me do instead of just asking for help with what I want. I firmly feel that this opportunity is a direct result of showing more willingness and asking for help to do his will.</p>

                <h3>3/9/2021</h3>
                <p>Last night, I promised my little girl that we could paint her nails today. After I got out my stuff, I let her know that I didn't forget and we can do it now. She looked at my things and said, "Mommy, I wanted to paint my nails with MY nail polish." I had just given it to her for her birthday. I remember putting them into a little box... and no clue what I did with it after that. I scoured the house searching for it. I racked my brain, but just couldn't remember what I had done with that little box. This is not uncommon. A side effect of one of my meds is memory issues. </p>
                <p>I knelt down and prayed. I told God how grateful I am that I live such a blessed life that the greatest of my concerns right now is finding this silly nail polish for my baby girl. I asked... I begged him to help me remember what I did with it. I asked him to please bring a vision to my mind of what I did with it.</p>
                <p>When I closed my prayer I stayed right there and just tried to let my mind go where it needed to. I thought of some shelves I had already searched. I went there. I looked where I was thinking of, and then thought, "I wouldn't have put it here because she would find it and play with it. I would have put it... HERE!" I took a step to the right and looked into the next shelf over, higher up. And that's exactly what I had done with it. I went to put it on the shelves and was concerned she'd find it and play with it, so put it on the next higher shelf over.</p>
                <p>I grabbed the little box of nail polish and went straight back to my room. I knelt down and tearfully thanked Heavely Father. The nail polish itself is of no real importance. I had finally felt an answer come and had recognized it. For so long, I have felt like Heavenly Father is answering me, but I just can't hear it. I felt so relieved and grateful and loved in that moment that my Father would help me with such a silly little thing as finding my little girl's nail polish and do it loudly enough that even I could hear him.</p>

                <h3>3/13/2021</h3>
                <p>You know, when I set this project and I had my question in mind, I couldn't help but feel that the whole project centered around my question. Getting an answer to my question would be the perfect end to the project.</p>
                <p>I have been struggling with this question for quite some time now. Fortunately, it's a yes/no question. A few weeks ago, I thought I knew what I believed the answer was, but because I didn't think I was feeling any answers at all, I couldn't tell if I was right. I still felt unsure of it. Was it really right?</p>
                <p>After talking it over with my husband (again), he made some very good points that didn't make sense if I was correct, but his thoughts made perfect sense. I thought and thought over it more and more and prayed some more. I actually changed my mind and told the Lord that I now believe <em>this</em> is the correct answer. I still didn't feel anything. Because I didn't feel anything, I didn't find this experience worthy of writing down.I have continued to pray about it, and continued not to feel any strong answer one way or another.</p>
                <p>On one of the discussion boards recently, someone referenced Ether 12:6, which has been a favorite of mine for some time now. I had an experience that led me to living here in Alabama that I used as the subject for a personal essay. <a href="images/12ANanciNewell.pdf" target="_blank">I'll link it here</a> so that you can read it as I don't feel like I need to fill this page with it. The point is that Ether 12:6 was a catalyst for one of my greatest experiences and the way it helped me was realizing that I can't move forward until I act with faith. So if I truly believe that I have come to the correct conclusion, and the Lord has not stopped me, then I need to proceed and act as though it is correct, and trust that the Lord will stop me if I'm wrong. The experiences then and now are not quite the same. Then, I had already received an answer and needed to act on it, and now I am still searching for the answer. I can't explain how, but I felt certain as I reflected on this verse and what I'm going through that the decision to act was imperative.</p>
                <p>As I moved forward, acting on the decision I had made, I tried to pay very close attention to how I feel. Do I feel guilty? Do I feel unclean? Do I feel unworthy? Do I feel a prick of conscience? Do I feel good? Do I feel calm?</p>
                <p>I realized that as I made my first decision, I was looking for what I think of as a stupor of thought or to forget the thing that was wrong, and I didn't think I had those. However, as I look back on it, what I did feel was continued uncertainty and confusion. When I changed my mind, and acted on that choice, I didn't feel confused, but I also didn't notice the confusion go away. It was only as I continued to pay attention to my feelings that noticed I wasn't confused anymore.</p>
                <p>I feel good. I feel calm. I feel loved. I feel answered, but not in the way I expected. I thought I would be able to ask my question, and whenever he answered loud enough that I could hear it over my own obstacles, that I would feel that burning in the bosom, that I would feel an solid yes or no. I have taught enough childrens' lessons to be able to tell others that the Lord doesn't always answer us in the way we expect, and yet when it happens to me it feels like a brand new concept that I needed to learn about.</p>

                <h3>3/16/2021</h3>
                <p>Now that my burning question is no longer a concern, I've turned my attention to how I can be a better wife, mother, and teacher for my family. This is not a new thing - I've asked about this a lot over the years, but as it was not my main focus when I started this project (and thus started praying regularly again), I guess it is newish.</p>
                <p>I feel like I need to focus on being a better homemaker, and teaching those particular skills to my kids. As I was asking what I need to do, I had an immediate thought, where I saw in my mind the dining room walls and blinds and thought that I need to clean those. I got started immediately after my prayer. Just to be clear, I'm not a very good homemaker. My house is cluttered, generally tidy-ish, but not generally clean. </p>
                <p>So I started by washing the walls. As I was doing so, my 5 year old came over and helped a little, but spent most of the time just sitting in a chair near me and told me that she just loves to be with me.</p>
                <p>By the time I moved on to dusting the blinds, she had moved on to playing. After dusting, I got through wiping down three with a wet rag when I got tired of doing it. Dusting didn't take all the dust and as I tried to wipe, it just made lots of rolled up wet clumps of dust that stuck to the blinds and was hard to get off. After thinking about it a moment, I changed tactics and got out a clean dish-brush and a bowl of soapy water and brushed the blinds, then wiped them to get the soapy water off. This was working well. I turned on some music and got to work.</p>
                <p>Before long, my 5 year old daughter came over and wanted to help me, so I got her a brush and a rag and we started working together, talking and giggling. Surprisingly, her efforts were actually very helpful, as she got the blinds soaking before I gave them a good scrub and the work went faster. </p>
                <p>When she decided she was done, I got to bring her close and tell her how proud I am of her for choosing to help me without being asked. And since she did the extra work and she worked hard, I felt like she earned some money for her work. I paid her $0.50 and we talked about tithing a bit, as well as how much I appreciated her help and how it made my work go so much more smoothly.</p>
                <p>Not much later, my 18 year old daughter came home from work. She came over and we started talking about her day. I gently said that if she's going to sit with me, she could help me with my work, too. She jumped up and joined me and we kept talking for a good 20 or 30 minutes.</p>
                <p>It's true, the work got done and I am glad of it, but the real blessing was not a cleaner house, it was that time with my girls where they came to me and we got to build our relationship. It wasn't forced, or planned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>3/18/2021</h3>
                <p>In continuing my efforts to be a better homemaker, I have been thinking about what I can do. Perfectly timed, one of my many homeschooling emails I receive was about just this subject. I got some ebooks that outline home skills for girls and home skills for boys. Looking through them, they are both simply home skills we all need, divided by the traditional roles. I decided to teach both sets of skills to both genders of children. While I do support and believe in the traditional roles of men and women in the home, I also know that we need to be able to take care of ourselves.</p>
                <p>My dear cousin stayed with us for most of 2020, and how has his own home. He is 30 and not yet married, so is a good example of why a man needs to know how to take care of his home. And my sister, whose husband is a doctor and works many long days, seems to be able to fix and accomplish anything in her house herself. This is most useful as he is away so much. She is a good example of why a woman needs to know how to use tools, unlog drains, and other skills that a man might traditionally use.</p>
                <p>I have been reading and planning the lessons for my children, and was happy to see that I am not so bad a homemaker as I thought. My children already have a good foundation to build on. Simple things like making a bed are already part of my children's lives, so it won't be a shock to them as we build upon it. I feel very good about my plan.</p>
                <p>As I was praying about it this morning, no new revelation struck me; no prompting to go and clean something specific. However, I just felt good about the efforts I'm making in this part of my life.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>3/29/2021</h3>
                <p>I feel like life has been pretty consistent lately. Nothing great and revelatory, just a good feeling that things are going well. I started a couple new books recently. "Accomplishing the Impossible" by President Nelson and "Saints." Both have been a great help in my efforts and studying. I really like reading "Saints" as we study the Doctrine and Covenants for the year. There are more details about the historical events that took place that help me to better understand.</p>
                <p>In my reading today, Joseph's final attempt to obtain the plates was coming up. Moroni told him that if he had not aligned his will with the Lord's in order to obtain the plates, they would not be obtained. I can't help but feel very grateful that I do not have that kind of pressure and timeline in my own efforts. Overcoming myself as I try to better align my will with his is very difficult. I can only imagine how Joseph must have felt. Through my readings, it seems that Joseph felt just as unworthy as I do, and yet God had great expectations of him. While I am no prophet, I can feel that God has great expectations of me, too. I have been refining and begining to implement my plans for teaching my children. I have felt nudges when certain things are good and when I should remove some things from my plans. In my exploration and research, I found an idea to develop into my plan, with modifications and tweaks, that I feel is just what we need. I really like this feeling of comfort and approval that I get as I put together these plans of mine and start putting them into place.</p>

                <h3>3/30/2021</h3>
                <p>Tonight I was making a quick trip to Sonic for some dinner for my husband and myself. As I turned into the parking lot, the unlit curb snuck up on me and I hit it... the corner of it. I pulled in and got out to look at it. It gouged a hole right in the side my tire. I could feel and hear the air hissing out, but it was not gushing out. Since I was already in the stall, I tried to get my food so that they could work on that while I work on the tire, but the gentleman said the stalls were closed and I'd have to use the drive-thru. Since the tire was still inflated, I went ahead to the drive-thru to get the food first and I'd change the tire afterward. It was dark, but the parking lot was lit well enough to accomplish the job. </p>
                <p>After I got the food and pulled into a parking stall, I started getting my equipment out, but couldn't find the spare. I haven't had to change a tire in the 5 years we've own the vehicle... It must be under the car. I went to check the tire again. Surprisingly, the tire didn't look deflated at all. I took a moment to consider. I was maybe 5 minutes from home, and it took longer than that to get through the drive-thru line with no visible change. I hopped in the driver's seat and said a prayer out loud. I told the Lord that I think it would be a better plan to drive home and change the tire there than to try to do it here alone in the dark. Given the time already elapsed and the lack of visible change in the tire, I believed I could make it safely. I asked him to stop me if I'm wrong. I actually expected someone to knock on the window or something else to actually stop me, but nothing happened. I started driving before finishing the prayer, feeling that if I believe this is the right thing to do and I had not yet felt any confusion or doubt about it, I needed to get moving.</p>
                <p>I made it home just fine, before the tire finished deflating. I felt quite pleased with the outcome - as pleased as you can be after destroying a 1 year old tire that's had almost no usage thanks to a pandemic keeping us home for a year. I felt like I had the Lord's go ahead to do what I had decided, and actually think it was a prompting that got me to look at the tire the second time (before getting the spare out). It's such a small and simple thing, but I feel like I was watched over during tonights events.</p>

                <p>Happy Conference!</p>
                <p>I have been directing my prayers lately to how I can be a better wife, mother, and teacher, and what I need to do to better do what God would have me do. I've been thinking a lot about that conversation with my neighbor, and concluded today and I really need to invite her to watch conference. This is so far outside of my comfort zone! After the first session today, I walked over and invited her. She said she wouldn't be able to come watch it with us, but would like to tune in at home while she's prepping food and whatnot and sit down during her downdown. I don't know if she will or not, but we had a very good conversation and I think she might. She mentioned she might sit with her 4 year old, so I offered some of the conference activities I use for my own kids, like Bingo (color in the square when you hear what they're talking about), coloring pages, etc. She said she'd really like that. I don't know what will come of this, but I feel a sense of peace that I acted on this prompting.</p>
                <p>As for being a better mother, I feel like today's conference went much better than last October. We spent more time listening and less time simply entertaining the little ones. They played the aforementioned Bingo, and it lasted a good two and a half talks! It was particularly adorable when Elder Holland said, "Can I talk about... (sorry, can't remember what he was talking about just now)?" and my 5 year old answered him, "Uh huh." They probably earned 30 M&M's. They get one every time they hear Jesus, Christ, or Jesus Christ, and my 6 year old collected extras by claiming them when he heard Savior and Lord as well, since they are also his names. And a few talks were viewed quietly while they ate crackers and cheese. Overall, they spend 4 hours in conference, mostly quiet, and even evidenced that they heard some of it. What's more - the teenagers didn't fall asleep at all. This is a win!</p>
